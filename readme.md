# Waflash Rewritten Demo
### What is Waflash Rewritten?
"Waflash is a WebAssembly Flash compatible player built with Emscripten. It supports both ActionScript 3.0 and 2.0."
Said [@vidkidz/waflash](https://github.com/vidkidz/waflash "@vidkidz/waflash").

**Our rewrite** is for **websites** who wants to add **flash games/apps to their website**, without **downloading 3rd Party Software.** *(e.g. the Flash Player App)*

~~With **easy** to use **instructions**, *that's (kinda) well documented*, **everyone** with **little html/js knowledge** **can know how to use this!**~~
#### Soon.

**Credits to [@Jinsoo Park](https://github.com/vidkidz "@Jinsoo Park") for making** *(what we suppose)* **the Orignal WaFlash!**
